## üìÅ Files
`video hand detection Angle.py` Extract the angle

`video hand detection coordinate.py` Extract x,y,z three-dimensional coordinates

## üìÉ Usage 
If you want finger angle extraction, run video hand detection Angle.py in vscode.

If you want finger coordinate extraction, run video hand detection coordinate.py in vscode.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Function
`video hand detection Angle.py`

<details>
  <summary>calculate_angle()</summary>
  This function calculates the angle between two vectors formed by three points in a three-dimensional space. 
  It first converts the input points into NumPy arrays, computes the vectors between points b-a and b-c, then calculates the cosine of the angle using the dot product and the magnitudes of the vectors. 
  Finally, it returns the angle in degrees.

`video hand detection coordinate.py`

<details>
  <summary>detect_hands_in_video()</summary>
This function detects hands in a video stream using the MediaPipe Hands model. It processes each frame of the video, identifies hand landmarks, and stores their 3D coordinates. If one or two hands are detected, it categorizes the landmarks into left and right hands accordingly. The function then saves the detected hand landmarks as JSON files. Finally, it displays the video with hand landmarks overlaid and allows for navigation through the frames using a trackbar.
  Finally, it returns the angle in degrees.

## üèÜ Result
The information on the finger extracted in the path specified by you is saved as a json file.

The json file is printed separately with both hands, and five fingers are generated as individual json files. The result will be a total of 10 json files.

If the hand was not detected in the video, it was made to be printed in an empty array in the json file.
